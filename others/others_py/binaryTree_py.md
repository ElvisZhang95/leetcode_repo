# Notes for the Problem and Links to the `.py` file

### No.xx1 [Replace String by Rules](.)

[Link to the Python file](./code/xx1_replaceByRules.py)

> 对于一个由小写字母组成的字符串，比如 "adcbf"，另外给一个小写字母到大写字母的可替换字典，比如 {'a': ['B', 'C'], 'b': ['X']}，表示 'a' 可以替换为 'B' 或 'C'，'b' 可以替换为 'X'。请写一个程序打印出所有替换生成的字符串，在这个例子中，结果为 {BdcXf, CdcXf}

### No.xx2 [Get Tree Height and Longest Path](.)

[Link to the Python file](./code/xx2_heightAndLongestPath.py)

**Notes**: 

* Both use recursive method to recurse by the left child and right child

---

### No.xx3 [Check Whether the Tree is Symmetric](.)

[Link to the Python file](./code/xx3_checkSymmetricTree.py)

**Notes**: 

* Should be one of leetcode problem, but cannot recall the problem number. Might add in the future

---

### No.xx4 [Validate a Binary Search Tree](.)

[Link to the Python file](./code/xx4_validateBinarySearchTree.py)

**Notes**: 

* **Definition** of Binary Search Tree: 
    - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
    - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
    - Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

* This problem also use recursion. To compare: 
    - left.value vs right.value
    - left.left vs right.right
    - left.right vs right.left

* Should be one of leetcode problem, but cannot recall the problem number. Might add in the future

### No.xx5 [Contruct Binary Tree from Preorder and Inorder Traverse](.)

[Link to the Python file](./code/xx5_construtFromPreorderInorderTraverse.py)

**Notes**: 

* Should be one of leetcode problem, but cannot recall the problem number. Might add in the future
